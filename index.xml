      <description>In a world packed of information, it is challenging to be aware of the latest technologies and innovations. For that reason, this wiki urge as a strategy to keep studying and summarize important concepts related to Data Science. In a word, it is a handy glossary of not so trivial terms that supports my Data Science profession.

      <description>Glossary with several platforms, tools, models and benchmarks. Just to be aware of the newest trends.
A Airflow (Apache): platform created by community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. Is scalable, dynamic, extensible and elegant.
AutoML (Google): train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise.
B Batch Jobs: jobs that can run without end user interaction, or can be scheduled to run as resources permit.</description>
